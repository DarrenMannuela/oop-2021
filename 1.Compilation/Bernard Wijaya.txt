From what I know, Java it self is a compiler that converts 
high-level java codes into byte codes that is also a type of machine code.
Java it self is quite special because other compilers usually requires special
configuration  in order to work at diffrent platforms. Java at the other hand,
succeeded in eliminating the platform issue because it reorganizes the compile-link-execute 
sequence at an underlying level of the compiler. Java creates the byte code 
which can be used at any platform with the condition that your device has Java
 installed. The byte code itself is a object file for a virtual machine and is not
an executable file.
